# Travenu
Travenu, an app created for travellers. We used available APIs for current weather (Open Weather API), currency converter, Google maps API and lot more. We used Firebase as the backend. Java and Xml was used as frontend. The UI is totally at par with the current standard of User experience. To sum up a whole trip of an individual there are only few applications and with limitations. A trip for a person is very hectic job to manage i.e. all hotel bookings, communication with co-travellers and few other things. To curb all these problems we have come up with a solution and that solution is Travenu, an android app which has features such as adding your itinerary, adding your co-traveller, currency converter and so on.

The main objective of our app Travenu is to create a travel planning android application. A travel planning app is garnering lot of attention in the coming days. It sums up a whole trip of an individual. There are only few apps and with many limitations. To curb all these problems, the ultimate solution is provided by our app.
